# 🚦 htmlintred

When we write html incorrectly, no much happens, no one will complain about it.

There are many ways to check if your html is written correctly, like for example using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
but something better we can do id integrate that into our development workflow, such as simply 
adding a css file into our project to highlight potencial problems.

### How can I do that?

```bash
$ npm install htmlintred
```

or 

```bash
$ yarn add htmlintred
```

### What does it do?

Add this css in the dev version of your project and... 🔥🔥🔥

**htmlintred** will highlight the bits that you need to take a loot at  with a red border.
